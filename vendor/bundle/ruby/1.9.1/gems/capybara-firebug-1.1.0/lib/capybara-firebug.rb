# Nothing is required by default, so you can specify `gem 'capybara-firebug'` in
# your Gemfile without actually loading any code (which requires the cucumber
# environment established by the 'cucumber' command).

# To load the firebug, require 'capybara/firebug' within a file in
# features/support/ or features/step_definitions/.
